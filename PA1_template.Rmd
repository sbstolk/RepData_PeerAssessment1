## Loading and preprocessing the data
The data was loaded from *activity.csv* using read.csv()
> opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, results = 'hold')
> setwd("/Users/blair_stolk/courseraR/repdata_data_activity/")
> rdata <- read.csv('activity.csv', header = TRUE, sep = ",",colClasses=c("numeric", "character", "numeric"))

The data was then cleaned and appropriately formatted 

> rdata$date <- as.Date(rdata$date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
> rdata$interval <- as.factor(rdata$interval)

Used *str(rdata)* to check that the data is in the correct format. 

>str(rdata)
##'data.frame':	17568 obs. of  3 variables:
## $ steps   : num  NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...
## $ date    : Date, format: "2012-10-01" "2012-10-01" "2012-10-01" ...
## $ interval: Factor w/ 288 levels "0","5","10","15",..: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

The 

> steps_per_day <- aggregate(steps ~ date, rdata, sum)
> colnames(steps_per_day) <- c("date","steps")
> head(steps_per_day)

The result is the sum of steps grouped by day. 

## date steps
## 1 2012-10-02   126
## 2 2012-10-03 11352
## 3 2012-10-04 12116
## 4 2012-10-05 13294
## 5 2012-10-06 15420
## 6 2012-10-07 11015

The next step is to make a histogram of this information. I chose *ggplot2* for plot creation. 

> ggplot(steps_per_day, aes(x = steps)) + 
+     geom_histogram(fill = "blue", binwidth = 500) +
+ labs(title="Steps per Day", x = "Number of Steps per Day", y = "Number of times in a day(Count)")


## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
